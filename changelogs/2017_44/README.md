### Issue 4687

The `tags` parameter in [Entity Group: Get Entities](../../api/meta/entity-group/get-entities.md#query-parameters), [Entities: List](../../api/meta/entity/list.md#query-parameters), [Metrics: List](../../api/meta/metric/list.md#query-parameters) now accepts wildcards to control the list of tags in the response.

* Retrieve members of the `docker-images` group. Add entity tags that start with `env.` to the response.

```ls
/api/v1/entity-groups/docker-images/entities?tags=env.*
```

### Issue 4686

The 'Entity Link' field resolves the tag value to an entity and displays a link to its editor page. The tooltip contains entity label, if available.

* The member type options were renamed with a new status message.

### Issue 4652

* Portals can be easily accessed from the top toolbar.

* Entity views can be added to the top menu with a custom icon.
