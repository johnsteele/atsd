### Issue 4643

### Issue 4635

The `ASC` direction allows retrieving first value for the specified series.

```json
[{
  "startDate": "1970-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "endDate":   "now",
  "entity": "nurswgvml007",
  "metric": "mpstat.cpu_busy",
  "limit": 10,
  "direction": "ASC"
}]
```

Refer to [series query](../../api/data/series/query.md#control-filter-fields) for additional details.

### Issue 4590

The list of examples is provided [here](https://github.com/axibase/atsd-api-python#examples).

### Issue 4544

Wildcard symbols present in the pattern can be escaped with a backslash `\` which serves as the default escape character.

```sql
-- Default escape character
WHERE tags.file_system LIKE '%a\_b%'
```

The escape character can be customized by adding an ESCAPE clause after the LIKE expression.

```sql
-- Custom escape character
WHERE tags.file_system LIKE '%a~_b%' ESCAPE '~'
```

In the example above, the underscore is evaluated as a regular character (not as a wildcard) because it is preceded by an ~ escape character.

### Issue 4404

Refer to [API documentation](../../api/meta/misc/search.md) for additional details.

```
GET /api/v1/search?query=inflation*&limit=2&metricTags=*&metricFields=units,dataType&entityTags=*&entityFields=timeZone
```
